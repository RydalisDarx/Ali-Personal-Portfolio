            <p style="padding-top:1rem;">
              The ultimate form of play is the one where everyone has fun playing around in their own little world, and guiding that 
              world with rules and a setting is what turns Dungeons and Dragons into a universal and wonderful game. The TTRPG genre
              has by far some of the most potential as a game, as it is truly limited by imagination and personal preference. 5th Edition 
              Dungeons and Dragons is a rules-heavy system made with the intention of slimming down the rules of previous editions, but there 
              is a lot of room for the system to grow, so under their Open License Agreement, I made new classes for people to play with and 
              have fun with for the system.

          <h1 class="left-margin">Understanding the  <span>D&amp;D </span>Game</h1>
          <p class="left-margin">
            Making homebrew for D&amp;D is easy to think about, but difficult to balance and integrate into the game seemlessly. I spent the better 
            half of my research into D&amp;D doing math and figuring how how the game is structured. These include research into how powerful every feat 
            is per level of a class, the potency of spells as you level up in the game, which spells were worth keeping and upcasting as opposed to using
            better spells in the higher levels, how damage type functions in the game as a whole, and how species are balances based on their features and 
            ability score bonuses.
          </p>
          <p class="left-margin">
            If that all sounded like gobbledygook, basically I wrote down a basic power level comparison for the game from level 1 to 20 for each class and
            tried to integrate my new classes in a way that felt natural to the game's already defined game mechanics. This included understanding core features 
            that defined each class: like Barbarians Rage or Sorcerer's Metamagic. Each class has a gimmick it revolves around defined in the first 3-5 levels that 
            they horizontally progress by adding more functionality. Comparing this to all of spellcasting having vertical progression in damage, it is hard to have 
            every class stay at the same power level since even the classes in D&amp;D are leaps and bounds different. 
          </p>
          <p class="left-margin">
            If I wanted to make new classes without copying something that already exists, I need to look for holes and opportunities in D&amp;D's own rules and setting to 
            base my homebrew upon.

          <h1 class="left-margin"><span>Integrating </span>into the <span>D&amp;D Rules and Setting</span></h1>
          <p class="left-margin">
            Through my research, I found that there are a couple of mechanics that D&amp;D could expand upon: Hit Dice, Spell Properties, Health, Tools/Items, and much more. 
            So, I made the decision to make a class for each of the mechanics I could fill in, rounding out 5th Edition with a list of classes that interacts with every part of 
            the ruleset and game in some interesting way. The next step was figuring out how to do so. Classes in 5th Edition have tiers of power based on level: 1-5, 6-10, 11-17, 
            18-20, and I had to follow a similar structure so these classes felt on par with the original 12.
          </p>
          <p class="left-margin">
            Not only did the power balance need to fit with D&amp;D, I needed to make sure that people weren't taken out of the setting of D&amp;D, so no matter the mechanics it needed 
            to make sense within the world of Forgotten Realms. It would not make sense to make a futuristic mech in a medieval fantasy setting, so my classes were all based around aspects 
            unexplored, such as the source of all magic or the planets, yet still felt like a fantasy setting where people can manipulate and grain power from such astronomical devices.

          <p class="left-margin">
            Making a D&amp;D class that fits in with the original game should also look like it came from the original game as well. Or well, as much as I could without 
            violating Copyright. Though, the two column presentation is very nice and professional notwithstanding, I added my own formatting onto it. Features that would 
            make it easier to read or reminders on how rules work so players dont have to go look for them and make the connections themselves. Like the arbalist's firearms
            in the picture on the side, I used Markdown and CSS to alter the document's default styling to add visual clarity to portions of it, while also maintaining the 
            two column presentation most TTRPG systems use.
          </p>
          <p class="left-margin">
            I never knew how to use Markdown, HTML, or CSS, and I did not have the help of frameworks like Bootstrap to help me. Making these documents took a lot of learning
            and reading how to make some HTML/CSS components from scratch and how to format Markdown to work alongside it. In the end I wanted reading my classes to be easy so
            playing them felt like playing the original game; I wanted my homebrew to be seemless and feel like something official.

            It takes a long time to make a final product for D&amp;D since testing it requires a group of 4-6 people to play, with a Game Master and players. 
            Through camapigns and villains alike, I and some testers played all of my classes with the original D&amp;D classes and sometimes just my themselves to 
            see how it felt, how powerful they were against monsters, and if they succeeded in the gameplay feel and fantasy I was aiming for. I plan on making more 
            in the future, but for now, here is the final product of the classes I have made and tested along with a document of the testing ground I used to 
            balance them.
