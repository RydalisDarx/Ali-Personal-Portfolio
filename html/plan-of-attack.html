            <h6><i>Plan of Attack - A Pokemon Showdown Pet Mod</i></h6>
            <p style="padding-top:1rem;">
              Pokemon Showdown is a pokemon battle simulator where many players can interact, make teams, and battle against 
              each other. Plan of Attack is a custom game within a seperate server forking the Pokemon Showdown website as its base.
              I work alongside many other people to make this metagame the best as possible for the many players that frequently play
              this passion project between many people. I even act as the main Monotype tier leader.

            As the Monotype tier leader for Plan of Attack, I analyze the current pokemon in the game and assign 
            tiers to them. I constantly work on the documents to ensure any new players coming into the tier know what
            is currently seeing the most success in the metagame.
          </p>
          <p class="right-margin">
            Alongside that, I work with a team of other tier leaders to do tiering action and balance patches to ensure that 
            the entire metagame include OU, UU, Monotype, and Ubers have a balanced level of play between all the viable pokemon 
            within every tier.

          <h1 class="left-margin">Understanding Each <span>Pokemon</span></h1>
          <p class="left-margin">
            Of course, it is one thing to just put Pokemon onto a list and call it a day. But, I take the time to analyze each pokemon, new and old, to
            report on why decisions are made. The general public of people playing the game needs to know why this list exists as is, and making these tiering 
            decisions with explanations and reasoning helps the playerbase understand what shifts are happening within the Plan of Attack meta.
          </p>
          <p class="left-margin">
            As the design team makes and adds new pokemon to the game, I take the time to report on them and add them to the game. It is then my responsibility 
            to balance, organize, and sort these pokemon within the tiers. Often do I work with the designers to see how pokemon can be overwhelming to the tier 
            and see if there is a compromise that allows the pokemon to exist without being banned without compromising the original intent of the pokemon.
          </p>
          <p class="left-margin">
            To this day, I work alongside the Plan of Attack team, ensuring the playerbase is content with the current tiering and balance of the pokemon within it. 
            I collect data on various pokemon every day tournaments are held for Plan of Attack, tabulating and calcating win rates and usage rates for every pokemon and 
            reflecting the data on the tier list and resources as they occur.
