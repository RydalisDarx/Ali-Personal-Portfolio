            <h5>Problem Statement: How do we help encourage young working Americans to improve their sleeping habits and counteract sleep deprivation?</h5>
            <p style="padding-top:1rem;">
              Many students out of college find it difficult to adapt to their
              working life. I joined the O.O.F team to look into the causes of their sleep deprivation and
              conduct user interviews and evaluations in this case study on sleep. Follow along the process of how
              I made a prototype to instill good sleeping habits into youth.

          <h1>Competitive <span>Analysis</span></h1>
          <p class="right-margin">
            First, I needed to see what I was up against, since sleep applications are very common on the
            app store. I decided to look at dedicated sleep apps and apps that integrate sleep functionality.
          </p>
          <p class="right-margin">
            From my analysis, I figured that most of them servicable to what people are looking for:
            a place to see their sleeping logs. However, a good amount of them are the same with little to no
            variation in function, just differences in UI. For the app, I needed to make something different, but
            not too different, so it can pull as many people to the app.

          <h1 class="left-margin">Interview and Research <span>Storyboard</span></h1>
          <p class="left-margin">
            I needed some more information, I knew what to make different, but now
            I need to know what to add. There are many things to add to the app, though in the end the user
            would know what they wanted, so I asked a good lot of them.
          </p>
          <p class="left-margin">
            Based off the interviews, I was able to discern something to target:
            shift work and sporadic sleeping because of an ever changing schedule. 
          </p>
          <p class="left-margin"><i>"I had to wake up 2 hours earlier just to get to the site on time... I always get home tired." -Interviewee #9</i></p>
          <p class="left-margin">
            This is similar to the first weeks of a new college term, so targetting this aspect of a person&apos;s
            schedule is definitely something many people would like aid for. And so, my aim became to support
            a tumultous lifestyle of work.
          </p>
          <p class="left-margin">
            Along with the interview, I also conducted some more research into sleep and how it works scienfically,
            specifically trying to find things that deter people from sleeping a lot. Since I was making an app, one
            peice of information caught my eye.
          </p>
          <p class="left-margin"><i>
              "The most recent available data suggests that nearly 83% of college students use their cell phones
              within 1h of going to bed, and around 66% check cell phone notifications before getting out of bed
              in the morning."</i><sup>1</sup></p>
          <p class="left-margin">
            Making a phone app meant I needed to account for people's phone usage as well, and how that has a
            negative impact on sleep. This is where a lot of my prototyping started.

          <h1>Mid and High Fidelity <span>Prototypes</span></h1>
          <p class="right-margin">
            Lastly was the prototyping, where I made a mid fidelity prototype highlighting some of the desired
            features in the app, where we can control what people can do on their phones to dissuade harmful habits.
            This is where the app lock and override password comes into play, to stop usage, but not forbit it in an
            emergency.
          </p>
          <p class="right-margin">
            The high fidelity prototype is when I started to apply some of the Gestalt Principles and section off
            parts of my mid fidelity prototype into their own sections with all the apps together to make it clear
            what apps are targetted by the app lock. This also included some touch-ups and condensing, like how an
            Allow list is redundant or how Notification Muting should be placed elsewhere for clarity.
          </p>
          <p class="right-margin">
            This application has a lot of extra functionality, such as making a schedule to sleep, and recommendations
            for people who want to sleep better. In the end, I feel that the app has enough to help young greenhorn workers
            get into the working lifecycle, and break those bad habits.
