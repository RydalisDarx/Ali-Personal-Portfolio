            <p style="padding-top:1rem;"><i>Spellbook is a bullet-hell boss-rush game in which you cast spells and dodge attacks all using your keyboard. 
                Both of these mechanics revolve around pressing certain keys or typing certain words. 
                Test your typing speed and reflexes in this fast-paced, action-heavy take on a typing game.</i></p>
            <p style="padding-top:1rem;">
              Games can be both fun and help train people's skills, in this case, we aimed to help people get use to typing.
              Many people dont know how to type properly or type without looking at their hands. I joined the Spellbook team as a 
              programmer to make the basis of the typing system used to cast spells, allowing people to input a spell command while 
              dodging attacks enemies throw at them, alongside information screens. This is the first formal project I joined, 
              so indulge me in my learning process.

          <h1 class="left-margin">Learning  <span>Unity</span></h1>
          <p class="left-margin">
            I walked into the team with a decently strong grasp of C++ and Java, getting my A.S. in Computer Science before transfering to UC Irvine 
            and joining the Spellbook team as my first game. Because of my prior experience, I knew learning C# would be easy, but learning the structure
            of Unity and the game development pipeline was going be harder. Spellbook's team of people were much more experienced with game development than 
            I was, so I played a more supplementary role doing the smaller things, or so I hoped I would.
          </p>
          <p class="left-margin">
            The first thing I worked on was one of the core parts of the gameplay loop: the spell input system. Since this was the beginning of development, I 
            also needed to make some spells to test the system as well, so I needed to learn a lot about Unity very quickly. I read almost an entirely book worth of 
            Unity documentation, in which I learned about Scriptable Objects and Colliders, and made myself a small fireball effect to test on enemies.
          </p>
          <p class="left-margin">Of course, I needed the system to be expandable for multiple spells and telling the game when someone is typing a spell, or typing to move.</p>

          <p class="left-margin">
            To seperate movement and casting, I made it so all capital letter inputs would cast spells. This meant that lowercase letters would move the player 
            and uppercase letters would add to the casting string. Afterwards, a simple Enter button press would fire the spell off if you spelled it correctly.
            We did not have to account for inputs simultaneously moving and casting, since we seperated it by character input and not button input, vastly simplifying 
            the input system and not relying on two seperate input controllers for movement and casting. This would be beneficial in other ways too, since through QA
            testing we found that people did not want to hold down the Shift key to cast spells and wanted to have a toggle, which already existed in this implementation 
            in the form of the CapsLock key! 
          </p>
          <p class="left-margin">
            Alongside my fireball, I made a rudementary spell factory that will create a new spell at runtime based on this input system I made, which would only be 
            the fireball when inputting "FIRE". However, as new spells were made, adding it to the system became simple as all the new spell effect needed to do was implement 
            the SpellFactory and have stats based on the Scriptable Object created for the spell. In retrospect, this system could be refined and a layer of abstraction can be
            removed, but this system was already expandable and adaptable out the gate.

          <h1>Working on  <span>UX Engineering</span></h1>
          <p class="right-margin">
            After implementing the basis of the spell system, I realized there were a lot of parts to the game that felt unintitive to users learning to type. So, 
            I started developing parts of the user experience, like the tutorial, spellcasting interface, and information screens. I stopped programming as much and
            instead worked with Unity's internal systems of Canvases and TextMeshes to make portions of the spellcasting interface, which shows the string you are constructing 
            when you are casting spells.  
          </p>
          <p class="right-margin">
            Alongside that, I worked on portions of the level select screen and the spell description page. These are to make sure players know what each spell in the game does 
            and can find a boss to fight without having to replay the tutorial of the game. Though, this also allows players to replay the tutorial whenever they want, if they take 
            a break from playing or need a refresher of how some things work. I wanted the game to play well, but I also wanted people to know how to play it.

            At the end of production, I realized what I wanted to focus on in my game development carrer. I loved 2D games and thinking about the user experience, but I also 
            enjoyed making well constructed back-end systems that store and send information between the user and system. This would be the start of what I would come to love in the 
            game development life cycle.
