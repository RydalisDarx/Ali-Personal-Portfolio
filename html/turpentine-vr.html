              no one can stop you from joining the masses of the activists. Why let some greedy advisors get in the way 
              of saving the world? Sign bills and seal deals on the phone to decide the fate of the company!

              Games are a storytelling device that can teach people and help them understand the world. Sometimes it can be used 
              to promote action towards a better world, in this case, a greener world. I joined the Turpentine VR team to make an 
              experience that will teach people about the pollution and global warming and teach them what we as people can do to 
              get lawmakers and companies to stop this global epidemic before it is too late. As a UI/UX designer for this game, I 
              had to understand the realm of VR to immerse people into the world of Turpentine.

          <h1 class="left-margin">Virtual Reality in <span>Unity</span></h1>
          <p class="left-margin">
            Turpentine VR was made in a very short time frame, 5 weeks, so learning the VR Toolkit in Unity was the most important step 
            towards making a useful interface in virtual reality. It comes as no surprise that the VR space is much different compared to 
            a computer screen, since players have the entire physical space of motion to move around and see the game world in, there is no one place 
            I can forcefully put information so the player can always have it at a glance. 
          </p>
          <p class="left-margin">
            All this meant is that there needed to be something in the game to ensure players would be able to find their way around, know what is happening 
            and still feel immersed in the game's world. If I couldn't do that last part, then what was the point of making it in VR anyways. This complication 
            forced me out of my comfort zone and made me think about how to implement this into Unity, since a normal Canvas wouldn't work on the VR headset viewport.
            Every Canvas needed to be a World Space canvas players can physically tap on and point at.
          </p>
          <p class="left-margin">
            So, I underwent the ideation process of making tablets, papers, and pressable buttons for the player to use in place of clicking on the screen, 
            as those would be instruments found in an office setting that can replicate traditional UI.

          <h1 class="left-margin"><span>Paper Prototypes </span>, literally.</h1>
          <p class="left-margin">
            Every tablet and peice of paper needed to have some semblence of verisimilitude in game, so their canvas interfaces had to have a professional look and design.
            Or, at least something you can reasonably see in an office setting. This included a start screen tablet for the player including a settings screen to tune the
            gameplay. I made sure to follow mobile-first design principles when I put it into the game, such as making the options bigger and simplifying dropbox options. 
            These inferfaces would be on mobile-seeming devices in VR, so I adapted the desktop designs to mobile eventually.  
          </p>
          <p class="left-margin">
            In the middle of gameplay, after many decisions were made in the game's story, there would be a stats page telling the player what happens as a result of their
            decisions. I made 2 designs but were unable to get feedback on them due to the 5 week time crunch. In the end, I went with the latter design to go with the mobile-first 
            design philosophy of all the interfaces for the game. Alongside that, the second design made better use of chunking and symmetry.

          <p class="right-margin">
            At the end of the 5 week production, the game is far from finished, but it was a good look and experience in learning VR. Unity's VR toolkit is interseting to work with,
            especially when designing interfaces for usability and accessability. From here, I would love to smooth the onboarding process for new players and figure out the pain-points in 
            my designs, especially in the context of VR UX design.
