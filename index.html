          <h1>What I can Do For  <span> Users </span>like <span>You</span>!</h1>
          <h3>My Traits, Skills, and Features </h3>
          <p>
            Throughout my college life at UC Irvine, making games and being a back-end programmer for most of my time there, 
            I realized the feeling I wanted to replicate from games I loved was through finely tweaking and understanding 
            how users experience games. From simple 2D games that help people type better to making sure a VR game feels 
            like reality, I figured that experiences should be assessible and it takes more than just simple programming 
            logic to understand this aspect of human interaction. I aimed to specialize what I did, not just back-end systems 
            management, but also user experience engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that I am out of college with a B.S. in Game Design and Interactive Media, I'm looking to apply my UX Engineering and Game Programming skills 
            to allow anyone and everyone to enjoy game experiences that are enamoured with and trying to find any opportunity to do so. I'm proficient with Unity, 
            Godot, and Unreal as a programmer and use Figma and Miro to regularly mockup prototypes and put ideas on paper. Alongside that, I'm use to making game 
            documents in HTML/CSS/JavaScript for analog games. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm no stranger to tackling difficult problems and returning solutions that are expandable and adaptive to what the user wants, be it accessability or a 
            simple viewport alteration. With experience making a couple of games on itch.io, along with my passion for games as a medium since I was young, I hope
            that something I've made will catch your eye.

          <h1>About <span>Me</span>!</h1>
          <h3>Why Am I here? What do I like? </h3>
          <p>
            I started playing games at a very young age with Pokemon Leafgreen, and from then on I looked at many 
            games to see what the medium had in store for me. My passion for games, though, started after playing 
            Final Fantasy 6. To see a game that made me reflect the emotions the characters had in it and make me want 
            to pursue their stories as if I were a part of the game was the eye-opening experience that made me choose 
            game development.
          </p>
          <p> 
            There are many other games I love, though, especially games with no set experience for the player, which allows people 
            to find their own entertainment. Games like Dungeons and Dragons or Blades in the Dark are my playgrounds for 
            putting every idea I've ever had in a playable form for people to experience with me. I also enjoy games that 
            let me sink hundreds of hours into thinking and understanding them, both while playing and between play sessions. 
            For example, Balder's Gate 3 and Divinity: Original Sin's character customizations and non-linear progressions allow me 
            to paint my own experience and think about how I want to experience each individual part of the game to my liking.  
          </p>
          <p>
            I guess that's one of the bigger things about me as a person, I like understanding and seeing things through a  
            theoretical looking glass. I spend a lot of time learning new things on my free time and seeing how I can apply my learnings 
            to my passions. I frequently read articles, books, and research papers about the wildest things to pique my curious mind and 
            see if theres something new I can re-imagine and distribute in my own way. Due to this, I tend to pick up and try out a lot of 
            creative fields like art and music or I learn more about cultures through learning langauges and living among them.
